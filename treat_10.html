            <h1>Problem</h1>
            <p> &emsp; Powdery mildew leaves a telltale white dusty coating on leaves, stems and flowers. Caused by a
                fungus, it
                affects a number of plants, including lilacs, apples, grapes, cucumbers, peas, phlox, daisies and roses.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>Solution</h1>
            <p>Rake up and destroy infected leaves to reduce the spread of spores. Also, give plants good drainage and
                ample
                air circulation. Avoid overhead watering at night; mid-morning is preferred to allow foliage to dry
                before
                evening. Commercial fungicides are available for powdery mildew, or you can spray with a solution of one
                tsp. baking soda and one quart of water as recommended by George “Doc” and Katy Abraham, authors of The
                Green Thumb Garden Handbook.

                Lilac, a highly aromatic plant, is a common victim of powdery mildew.</p>
